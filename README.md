# Short Presentation of My Master

My final presentation is [here](main.pdf).

I would like to give credit where it is due. The following parts of this README explains where the theme I have used comes from. I have only included the files from that repository which were necessary for my presentation. Hopefully I am not breaking any license agreements. 


# BeamerNTNU

A LaTeX beamer theme for NTNU presentations

## Overview

This is based on the official Powerpoint templates and the beamer theme guidelines.
The [documentation](https://github.com/ntnu-tex/beamerthementnu/blob/master/ntnu-beamer-documentation.pdf) provides more detail on how to get started, also for people who are not that expierienced in using LaTeX (See “Start a Presentation”).
The theme covers both an english and a norwegian option as well as three different styles.

This repository is maintained by [Mattia Veroni](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/mattia.veroni) and [Ronny Bergmann](https://www.ntnu.edu/employees/ronny.bergmann).
For technical questions an easy way is, to open an [issue here](https://github.com/ntnu-tex/beamerthementnu/issues/new).
If you want to contribute features or help improving this theme, feel free to also get in touch with us.
